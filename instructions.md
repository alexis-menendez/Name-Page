# Module 12: Crafted by Alex
Being a web developer means being part of a community. You need a place to share your projects, whether you're applying for jobs, freelancing, or collaborating with other developers.

# React Portfolio
Now that you’ve completed multiple projects, you’ll create a portfolio using React. This will help you stand out from developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies.
For this challenge, you’ll deploy your application to Netlify. Follow the instructions in activity 27-Evr_Git-Deploy to create a build that you can deploy.

# User Story
As an employer looking for candidates with experience in single-page applications, I want to view a potential employee’s React portfolio so I can assess their skills for an open position.

# Acceptance Criteria
- The portfolio is a single-page application.
- When loaded, the page displays a header, a content section, and a footer.
- The header contains the developer’s name and navigation menu.
- The navigation includes About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, with the current section highlighted.
- Clicking a navigation title updates the content below without reloading the page.
- When first loaded, the About Me section is selected by default.
- The About Me section contains a photo/avatar and a short bio.
- The Portfolio section shows six projects with titled images, links to the deployed applications, and GitHub repositories.
- The Contact section includes a form with fields for name, email, and message.
- If a user leaves a form field empty, they receive a notification that it is required.
- If an invalid email is entered, a notification appears.
- The Resume section includes a downloadable resume link and a list of proficiencies.
- The footer contains links to the developer’s GitHub, LinkedIn, and another platform (e.g., Stack Overflow or Twitter).

# Getting Started
Your portfolio should include:
- A Header component that appears on multiple pages.
- A Navigation component within the header to render different sections.
- A Project component used multiple times in the Portfolio section.
- A Footer component that appears on multiple pages.
The contact form should work the same way as in your module project since this application doesn’t have a back end yet. You can add your email and phone number to the Contact page for now.

# Projects
Each project in your portfolio should include:
- An image of the deployed application (GIF or screenshot).
- The project title.
- A link to the deployed application.
- A link to the GitHub repository.

# Design Guidelines
Your portfolio should look polished and professional:
- Use a mobile-first design.
- Choose a color palette beyond the default Bootstrap theme. Consider using Coolors or other color generators.
- Ensure the font is readable, and colors don’t cause eye strain.
- Consider using animations and React component libraries (not required but recommended).
